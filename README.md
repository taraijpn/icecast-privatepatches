* icecast-2.4.4-removeadminlink.diff

  * The `admin` link may not be necessary for pure listner.

* icecast-2.4.4-movelistenerurl.diff

  * `http://localhost:port/` is not used. Please access `http://localhost:port/listener`.

  * This is one of the ways to avoid crawlers.

  * Because `status.xsl` is fixed, we can't hide the listener page from humans.
